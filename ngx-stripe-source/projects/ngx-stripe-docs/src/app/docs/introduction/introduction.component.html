    <p class="mt-4">
      Ngx Stripe is a thin wrapper around <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js" target="_blank">Stripe Elements</a>. It allows adding Elements to any <strong>Angular</strong> app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/js" target="_blank">Stripe.js reference</a> covers complete <strong>Elements</strong> customization details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use Elements with any Stripe product to collect online payments. To find the right integration path for your business, explore <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js" target="_blank">Stripe Docs</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library provides three major elements:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>Lazy script loading</li>
      <li>Element Components</li>
      <li>Stripe Observable wrapper</li>
    </ul>
    <ngstr-subheader subheader="New major version" link="new-major-version"></ngstr-subheader>
    <p>
      This project has not been updated for a while.
      After reviewing the state of the art for React and Vue counterparts,
      some major changes are going to be introduced to align this project with <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/js" target="_blank"> Stripe Elements </a>.
    </p>
    <ol role="list">
      <li>ngx-stripe will no longer maintain its own interfaces. Instead, @stripe/stripe-js has been added as peer dependency. This will make the library easier to maintain and avoid mistakes.</li>
      <li><a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/js" target="_blank">Stripe Service</a> has been updated with all the missing APIs from StripeJS.</li>
      <li>All the missing <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react#element-components" target="_blank">Element Components</a> like IBAN, Ideal, FPX, ... have been added.</li>
      <li>Request Payment Button now has full support.</li>
      <li>Added <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://stripe.com/docs/js/element/the_element_container" target="_blank">Container Style</a> functionality support.</li>
      <li>A <a class="ngstr-link" href="https://github.com/richnologies/ngx-stripe/blob/main/MIGRATION.md" target="_blank">Migration</a> guide has been added with details of what have changed.</li>
      <li>The new version of library is compatible from Angular 6+ major versions. Check the <span class="ngstr-highlight">Installation</span> section see how to install an older version.</li>
      <li>All documentation has been moved to this new site.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Finally, in order to ease the transition,
      we are naming the old version of the library <span class="ngstr-highlight">legacy</span> and we have created some npm tags to make it easy to install older versions.
      Check <span class="ngstr-highlight">Installation</span> to say a complete list of available versions.
