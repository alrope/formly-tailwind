      In some scenarios you may want to fully control the style,
      the loading flow or simply the provided Element Components
      don't suit well for your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those cases you manually mount the Stripe Element on any DOM element.
      In the example bellow, we are mounting a Card Element into the div
      with id <strong>card-element</strong>. We need to do 3 things the Card Component usually do for us:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>Fetch the Elements Object</li>
      <li>Create the Stripe Element. In this example a card element, but the same approach can be use for any other support payment method.</li>
      <li>Mount the element into the DOM</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With those technique we have access the the Stripe Element directly.</p>
    <ngstr-panel type="warning">
      This is a more flexible approach, but also a little bit more involving
    </ngstr-panel>
