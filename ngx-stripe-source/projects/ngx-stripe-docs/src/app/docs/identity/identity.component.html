      Stripe Identity helps you confirm the identity of global users to prevent fraud, streamline risk operations, and increase trust and safety.
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>Capture IDs with a conversion-optimized verification flow</li>
      <li>Verify authenticity of global ID documents</li>
      <li>Match photo ID with selfies, and validate SSN</li>
      <li>Access collected images, and extracted data from ID document</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2><strong>Verify your users identity docuemnts</strong></h2>
    <p>There are four ways to implement Identity:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>Modal — show a document upload modal inside your website.</li>
      <li>Redirect — send your users to Stripe to upload their identity documents.</li>
      <li>iOS Beta — show a document upload sheet inside your app.</li>
      <li>Without code — manually create verifications in Dashboard and share a link with your users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this case we are going to use ngx-stripe to trigger the modal window within
      our Angular App. We need to create a verificación session in the server
      and then use the client secret in the front to trigger open the modal.
      Is a very similar to the Checkout flow.

    <ngstr-code-group>
      <ngstr-code name="identity.component.ts" [code]="identityOneTS"></ngstr-code>
      <ngstr-code name="identity.component.html"[code]="identityOneHTML"></ngstr-code>
      <ngstr-code name="server.js" [code]="identityOneServer"></ngstr-code>
    </ngstr-code-group>
    <h2><strong>Verify your users identity using redirect</strong></h2>
    <p>
      As discuss in the previous section, there is an alternative flow using redirect
      instead of a modal window. In this case you don't need this library or
      to bootstrap Stripe in the front at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      All you need is to create a Verification Session in the server and pass
      the redirect url to the front. From there, you can simply redirect the user
      to that url.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, to see more details on a full example, please check the official Stripe Docs.
